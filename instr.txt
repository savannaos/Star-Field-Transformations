DATA
stars:
1. star.hpp - header for star data structure
2. star_gen.cpp - generates star coordinations and outputs into star_data.txt

frames:
1. movement.hpp 
2. starMovement.hpp - specifies how all the stars will move
3. starCoordBounds.hpp - dimensions for view
4. frame_gen.hpp - reads in star_data.txt and saves the stars. For each frame in the desired sequence, it will
      -write the star values of the stars that are located within the view specified by starMovement.hpp.
      -shift all the stars as specified in starMovement.hpp.
      
pvpfiles:           
1. pv_frames.m - Reads and saves the frame files into a cell array that follows the format needed in writepvpsparsevaluesfile.m. Converts theta and phi values to x and y coords in an image. 

visualize:
1. plotStars.m - Reads in pvp file and extracts coordinates to plot for each frame. Should see expected movement.
2. plotFrames.m - to plot stars before generating the pvp file. 
--------------
RUN TESTS
1. Install PetaVision
2. Build PetaVision
3. Lua file
4. params file
5. execute mpirun
---------------
STAROUT (output files)
1. organized into folders by date. 
2. includes visuals
3. actual pvp files are in /nh/compneuro/scratch/starOut/ (due to size of files)
---------------
ANALYSIS
1. analysis_SPM.m - original analysis script
2. analysis_energy.m - plots the energy per batch
3. analysis_singleLayer.m - only uses one layer in network: plots the energy, reconstructions, features, feature activations, and the muggle's prediction. 
4. analysis_recon - plots only the reconstructions
---------------
DOCUMENTS
1. abstract, poster, and slides
2. references
